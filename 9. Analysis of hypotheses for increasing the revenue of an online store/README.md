# Analysis of hypotheses for increasing the revenue of an online store 

#### Research Objectives: 
Using the data of the online store, prioritize hypotheses and evaluate the results of A/B testing using various methods

#### Results of the research:
Prioritization of hypotheses was conducted using the ICE and RICE frameworks. The results of the A/B test were analyzed, and graphs of cumulative revenue, average check, and conversion rates for each group were plotted. Statistical significance of differences in conversions and average checks was calculated using both raw and cleaned data. The decision was made to discontinue the test due to its impracticality

#### Skills and tools:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, A/B testing, statistical hypothesis testing, RICE framework, ICE framework, product analytics
