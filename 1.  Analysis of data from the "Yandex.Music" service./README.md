# Analysis of data from the 'Yandex.music' service

#### The goal of the research is to test three hypotheses:

1. User activity depends on the day of the week, and this dependence manifests differently in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
2. Different genres dominate Monday mornings in Moscow compared to St. Petersburg. Similarly, different genres prevail on Friday evenings depending on the city.
3. Moscow and St. Petersburg have preferences for different music genres. In Moscow, pop music is more frequently listened to, while in St. Petersburg, Russian rap is more popular.

#### Results of the research: 
It was established that there are more similarities than differences between users in the two cities. User activity in Moscow and St. Petersburg varies throughout the week. Musical preferences in the two cities are similar, including the beginning and end of the week, with pop music being the most popular genre.

#### Tools: 
Python, Pandas, data processing, duplicates, missing values, logical indexing, grouping, sorting
